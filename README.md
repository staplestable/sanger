# Sanger
Simple audio player for treble and bass sequences using note frequencies, made in Java

This project was made for fun, but I'll eventually come back to add more features, such as:
- The ability to draw your own melody lines
- The ability to change audio wave shapes

## Installation

Ensure you have a JRE set up, clone this project, enter the source/src folder, and then compile all the .java files:

```
javac dev/damasc/sanger/*.java
```

## Usage

For now, it's just a simple melody player configured to play _"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"_. To use it, run the following command:

```
java dev/damasc/sanger/Main.class
```
